  Growing up my favourite games were on the Nintendo 64, which makes sense because it was the first home console my family owned. My 6 year old mind was blown when my brother and I first booted up Super Mario 64 and saw Mario standing in front of us in the most cutting edge 3D graphics. My mind continued to get blown as the years went on and I played games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, Donkey Kong 64, Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, the list goes on... These games and this console helped shape who I am today and I have a lot to thank them for. 
  
  Fastforward a few decades and I stumbled across a website called Bitbuilt (https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php), a site dedicated to the hacking and portabilization of home video game consoles using various methods like cutting motherboards down in size, developing custom PCBs for power management and sound, and many other amazing things the talented members have come up with. I spent years lurking on the website in awe of what people could achieve, consistently coming back every few months to scour through the forums and see what advances people have made. 
  
  Finally 2020 arrives and my pandemic boredom was peaking until I decided to go check up on BitBuilt. While scrolling through posts I stumble across the post for the annual summer building contest and I immediately knew I had found the cure for my boredom. I decided right then and there that despite never attempting a portable and knowing full well I would most likely fail, it would be such a fun way to flex my CAD skills as well as pick up some new ones along the way.

<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
  In this project my goal was to utilize my knowledge of CAD and specifically designing for FDM 3D printing to it's full potential and build an ergonomic, sleek, yet still retro looking portable Nintendo 64. Before starting my design, I set my constraints:
  
  * All parts must fit in my 3D printer's print volume of 200mm<sup>2</sup>
  * I will reuse the original controller buttons and controller chip
  * I wanted to learn how to design my own custom PCBs for the controller, power management system and audio amplifier
  * The console should have a cartridge slot (as opposed to an integrated flash card with all of the games on a microSD card, such as the [Everdrive 64](https://krikzz.com/store/home/55-everdrive-64-x7.html)
  * It's gotta look cool
 
  Once the design constraints were fleshed out, it was time to begin.
